## The Problem We're Solving

### **The Global Food Waste Crisis**

Every year, our world faces a devastating paradox:

- **1.3 Billion Tons** of food is wasted globally every year
- **$1 Trillion** worth of food ends up in landfills
- **828 Million People** suffer from hunger worldwide
- **30-40%** of food produced in India never reaches consumers
- Restaurants, hotels, and events discard perfectly edible food daily
- Meanwhile, millions go to bed hungry every night

### **The Disconnect**

The real tragedy isn't just the waste—it's the **disconnect between surplus and need**:

- **Donors** (restaurants, hotels, events, individuals) have excess food but no efficient way to donate
- **Receivers** (NGOs, shelters, food banks, individuals in need) struggle to find reliable food sources
- **Time-sensitive nature** of food donations makes coordination critical
- **Lack of transparency** prevents donors from tracking their impact
- **Trust and safety concerns** discourage participation

### **Our Impact**

FoodShare bridges this critical gap by creating a **trusted, efficient, and transparent platform** that:

**Reduces food waste** by connecting donors with receivers in real-time  
**Fights hunger** by ensuring surplus food reaches those who need it most  
**Builds community** by fostering a culture of sharing and compassion  
**Provides transparency** through analytics and impact tracking  
**Saves resources** by preventing edible food from reaching landfills  
**Environmental impact** - reducing food waste means less methane emissions from landfills
